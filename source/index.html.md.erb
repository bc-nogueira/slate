# Introduction

The Kickserv API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

The Kickserv API doesn't support bulk updates. You can work on only one object per request.
